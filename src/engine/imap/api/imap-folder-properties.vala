/**
 * Geary.Imap.FolderProperties represent the Geary API's notion of FolderProperties but
 * also hangs additional useful information available to IMAP-specific code (in the Engine,
 * that includes imap, imap-engine, and imap-db).
 *
 * One important concept here is that there are two IMAP commands that return this information:
 * STATUS (which is used by the background folder monitor to watch for specific events) and
 * SELECT/EXAMINE (which is used to "enter" or "cd" into a folder and perform operations on mail
 * within).
 *
 * Experience has shown that these commands are *not* guaranteed to return the same information,
 * even if no state has changed on the server.  This would seem to be a server bug, but one that
 * has to be worked around.
 *
 * In any event, the properties here are updated by the following logic:
 *
 * When a folder is first "seen" by Geary, it generates an Imap.FolderProperties object with all
 * the fields filled in except for status_messages or select_examine_messages, depending on which
 * command was used to discover it.  (In practice, the folder will be first recognized via STATUS,
 * but this isn't guaranteed.)
 *
 * When new STATUS information comes in, this object's status_messages, unseen, recent, and attrs
 * fields are updated.
 *
 * When a SELECT/EXAMINE occurs on this folder, this object's select_examine_messages, unseen,
 * recent, uid_validity, and uid_next are updated.
 *
 * Over time, this object accumulates information depending on what operation was last
 * performed on it.
 *
 * The base class' email_total is updated when either *_messages is updated; however, SELECT/EXAMINE
 * is considered more authoritative than STATUS.
